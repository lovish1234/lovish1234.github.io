Instance segmentation is one of the most important perception tasks in computer vision. We present an approach to <strong>optionally</strong> use the depth given along an image to aid the performance on this task. We observe that depth information incorporated through Spatially-Adaptive (DE)normalization (SPADE) results in significant improvement on the task on NYUv2 dataset. Additionally, we observe that the use of ODM (Optional Depth Module) helps to prevent the degradation of performance even when the depth data is unavailable to the network.


<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

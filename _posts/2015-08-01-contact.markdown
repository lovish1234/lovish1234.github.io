Collected a dataset in which users are wearing soft and cosmetic contact lenses. Emperically proved
that a person wearing either of those lenses leads to an average degradation of 3.10% in EER when subject is wearing soft lens and 17.34% when subject is wearing cosmetic lens. Further, we propose
a cosmetic lens detection approach based on Local Phase Quantization(LPQ) and Binary Gabor Pattern(BGP).  Experiments conducted on publicly available IIITD Vista, IIITD Cogent,
ND 2010 and self-collected dataset indicate that our method outperforms previous lens detection techniques in terms of Correct Classification Rate and false Acceptance Rate. The
results suggest that a comprehensive texture descriptor having blur tolerance of LPQ and
robustness of BGP is suitable for cosmetic lens detection. -->
